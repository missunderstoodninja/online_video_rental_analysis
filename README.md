# Rockbuster Stealth LLC
For this project I worked on Rockbuster Stealth LLC a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. My tasks were to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a RDBMS. Then, I used <i>SQL</i> to analyse the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that business may have. The analysis was conducted using <b>PostgreSQL</b>.

The data set contains information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments.
